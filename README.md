# Introduction

Hi! I'm Leong Tze Heng, a student in the Software Maintenance
and Evolution course.
I expect to learn a lot about modern software maintenance
practices and how to work with legacy systems.
- **Fun fact**: I love to travel and challenge myself with new tech.
- **Course expectations**: To gain hands-on experience in
maintaining and evolving software.
